*biomes* ships spatially explicit raster layers of **31 published global terrestrial
biome schemes** (compiled by Fischer et al. 2022) in one harmonised format, at a native
**10 × 10 km** resolution, together with functions to classify occurrence records into
biome classes and to choose the most suitable scheme for a dataset in a transparent,
reproducible way.

Because the layers are global at 10 × 10 km, *biomes* is built for **macroecological and
large-scale biogeographical questions** (continental to global). It is **not** intended for
fine-grained, national-extent analyses, where the 10 × 10 km grid is coarse.

The workflow follows four steps (see the four vignettes below):

1. **Assembling occurrence records and biome schemes**.
2. **Choosing a biome scheme**: rank the 31 schemes for your data.
3. **Occurrences-to-biome classification**: assign records to biome classes.
4. **Output and visualisation**: tabulate and visualise the result.

A single wrapper, `biomes_full()`, runs all four steps in one call.

## Terms used in this package

- **biome scheme**: one of the 31 published classification systems (e.g. the vegetation
  scheme of Ramankutty & Foley 1999).
- **biome class**: a single category within a scheme (e.g. *savanna*, *tropical evergreen
  woodland*).
- **biome scheme number**: the number (1-31) that identifies a scheme; it is the value you
  pass to the `scheme` argument. Numbers follow the order of the biome inventory
  (Fischer et al. 2022).

## Installation

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("azizka/biomes")
```

`biomes` depends on **terra** and installs **ggplot2**, **sf**, **viridis** and **tidyterra**
automatically. The combined figure (`cowplot`) and the GBIF download path (`rgbif`,
`CoordinateCleaner`) live in `Suggests` and can be installed on demand.

## Quick start: the one-call workflow

`biomes_full()` runs the whole four-step workflow. Give it an occurrence dataset (or a taxon
name); it chooses the best-fitting biome scheme, classifies the records, tabulates them, and
(optionally) builds a figure. No figure is drawn by default (`plot = "none"`, the fastest
option). `plot = "all"` returns the combined figure in `res$plot`, while a subset of
`c("rank", "map", "barplot")` returns the panels **individually** (no panel letters) in
`res$rank`, `res$map` and `res$barplot`.

```r
library(biomes)

data(biomes_example)

# from an occurrence dataset:
res <- biomes_full(x = biomes_example)   # scheme = "best"; no figure by default

res            # short summary
res$scheme     # the chosen biome scheme number
res$table      # occurrence records per biome class

# add a figure with `plot`; the combined figure is returned in res$plot:
res <- biomes_full(x = biomes_example, plot = "all")
res$plot
ggplot2::ggsave("biomes_figure.png", res$plot, width = 9, height = 12, dpi = 300)

# the panels individually (no a/b/c letters) in res$rank / res$map / res$barplot:
res <- biomes_full(x = biomes_example, plot = c("rank", "map", "barplot"))
res$rank; res$map; res$barplot

# from a taxon name instead of a dataset (downloads from GBIF), e.g. a whole order:
res <- biomes_full(taxon = "Fagales", plot = "all")
```

To force a specific scheme, pass its biome scheme number; to rank within one methodological
group, pass a scheme type:

```r
biomes_full(x = biomes_example, scheme = 1)            # fixed scheme
biomes_full(x = biomes_example, scheme = "vegetation") # best vegetation scheme
```

The same pipeline as individual building blocks, following the four workflow steps:

```r
# Step 1: Assembling occurrence records and biome schemes
data(biomes_example)
schemes <- biomes_get()

# Step 2: Choose a biome scheme
ranking <- biomes_rank(biomes_example, scheme_type = "vegetation")
best <- attr(ranking, "best_scheme")

# Step 3: Occurrences-to-biome classification
cls <- biomes_classify(biomes_example, scheme = best)

# Step 4: Output & visualisation
biomes_tab(cls)
biomes_visualise(biomes_example, scheme = best)
```

`biomes_visualise()` draws up to three panels (`rank`, `map` and `barplot`) combined into
one figure; select any subset with `panels`, e.g. `panels = "map"`.
