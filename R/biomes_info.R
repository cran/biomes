#' Print metadata for selected biome definitions
#'
#' Prints a human-readable summary of the biome schemes shipped
#' with the package. For each requested classification the function prints
#' the publication, the criteria and methodology used to define the
#' biomes, a short description, the number of biomes, the biome
#' scheme number, and a list of biome names with their raster values.
#'
#' This is the *interactive* sibling of the `biomes_information` data set:
#' use [`biomes_information`] when you want the raw metadata table (e.g.
#' to subset, filter, or join programmatically), and `biomes_info()` when
#' you want a quick read of the most relevant fields for a specific
#' biome scheme.
#'
#' @param x Integer vector of biome scheme numbers between 1 and 31. If
#'   `NULL` (the default), information for all 31 schemes is printed.
#'
#' @return Invisibly returns the integer vector of biome scheme numbers that
#'   was printed. The function is called for its side effect of printing
#'   to the console.
#'
#' @seealso [`biomes_information`] for the underlying metadata table and
#'   [`biomes_legend`] for the mapping from raster values to biome names.
